**Data Analyst | Data Enthusiast | Problem Solver**

Hi there! I'm Trifina , a passionate Data Analyst with a strong background in the automotive industry and ready to explore new avenues I can apply my love for Data. 
I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions. With expertise in tools like Python, SQL, R, and Excel, I enjoy diving deep into datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies. 

My experience includes:
1. Data Visualization: Proficient in creating clear, impactful visualizations using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Matplotlib.
2. Statistical Analysis: Strong foundation in statistical methods, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling to provide data-driven solutions.
3. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Skilled in data wrangling, ETL processes, and ensuring data integrity across various systems.
4. Automation: Experience in automating reports and dashboards to streamline workflows and improve efficiency.

I believe that data tells a story, and my goal is to help organizations read and understand that story to make informed, strategic decisions. 
I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow, and I enjoy collaborating with others who share a passion for data.
